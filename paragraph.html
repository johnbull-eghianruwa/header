    <p>THE words above are a translation of the official royal motto of King Charles IX of Sweden. In Latin it reads: “Iehovah solatium meum.” This king was one in a line of several generations of rulers in Sweden, from 1560 to 1697, who highlighted God’s name in Hebrew or Latin characters on coins, on medals, or in personal mottoes. Charles IX also instituted the Royal Order of Jehovah. On the day of his coronation in 1607, Charles wore a necklace called the Jehovah chain.

        What led these monarchs to such practices? Scholars believe that the Calvinist movement in Europe at that time, coupled with respect for the Bible, influenced them. As well-educated Renaissance sovereigns, they were evidently familiar with the Latin version of God’s personal name, Jehovah. Some no doubt realized that the name appeared thousands of times in the original Hebrew Bible text.
        
        It is well documented that in various parts of Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries, the name Jehovah often appeared on coins and medals as well as in public buildings and churches. God’s own statement, quoted at Exodus 3:15, was evidently commonly accepted and respected: “Jehovah . . . is my name to time indefinite.”</p>

<h1>Violent Crime​—What Is Happening?</h1>

<P>FRANK and Gabriella strolled along the Oregon, U.S.A., seashore in the early morning hours, watching the sunrise. They had no inkling of what was about to happen. Minutes later, they were both dead, shot in the head at close range. Was it vengeance? Or jealousy? Neither. The gunman, a stranger, fulfilled a fantasy​—he wanted to know what it felt like to kill someone.</P>
<h2>A Different Type of Crime?</h2>

<P> has been with us for centuries, but the types cited above cause people to exclaim: “Why? How could anyone even think of doing such a thing?” Although common crimes, like thievery or fraud, may not turn many heads, there is an increasing category of deeds that grabs media attention and causes people to say to themselves, ‘This is senseless! What is happening to this world?’</P>
